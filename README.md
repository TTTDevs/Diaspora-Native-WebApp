# Diaspora Native WebApp

# >> This app is no longer maintained <<

### About
This is an unofficial Diaspora social nerwork app.
It's under development so please submit any bugs you might find.

### License
It's released under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (see LICENCE).

### Native...? Webapp...?
It's "native" because it's developed in Java + the Android SDK (Android Studio), not a hybrid framework like React or Flutter.
It's a webapp because it uses the Diaspora mobile web interface (it doesn't use an API, because it doesn't exist yet)

### Why a webapp is better than just using the mobile site on a browser?
Basically it provides better integration with the system, customized interface and functions, and a nice little icon that takes you directly to your favorite social network :)

### System Requirements
The minimum version supported is Ice Cream Sandwitch, Android version 4.0.3 (or API 15)

### Permissions
It requires access to the Internet and to external storage to be able to upload photos when creating a new post.

### Third party libraries
It uses the following third party libraries:
- https://github.com/futuresimple/android-floating-action-button (will be removed in future releases)
